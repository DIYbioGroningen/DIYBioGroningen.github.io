title: DIYbio at ESEB and Noorderzon
---

August 20th-25th DIYbio will be doing outreach for the ESEB conference
at Noorderzon. Twice a day, at 14:00-15:00 and 16:00-17:00, kids are welcome 
to extract DNA from strawberries. For adults, the experiment may seem 
trivially simple. It is, yet for kids, this experiment is a major eye-opener:
for them, it often is the first time to see and touch DNA. They have the
most interesting (and funny) questions about DNA. After this workshop, you
will not evolve into a strawberry :-)
